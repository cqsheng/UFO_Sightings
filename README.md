# An Analysis of UFO Sightings

## Overview of Project
    This project is used to create a webpage that contains a table of a list of UFO sightings.
### Purpose
    The purpose is to create a interactive webpage that lists various UFO sightings. The list is stored on a table with various information about each sighting, the web page user is then able to filter the table based on 5 different criteria to narrow down the long list of sightings showing up on the table.

## Results
    The users of the webpage will be able to filter the long list based on their own input on the left side.
### Total and average fares for different city types:
    As pictured below, the web page contains a section on the left side that contains a place for the user to filter the table on the right side using up to 5 different filters. The table will update whenever the user enters any a value into any of the 5 search criteria and presses 'Enter' on their keyboard. The javascript program will then take in the user inputted value to filter the table on the right to only show the sightings that match their search criteria. The user does not need to enter all 5 criteria to search.

## Summary
    The new design has some advantages in letting the user search with multiple filters at once, but it also has some drawbacks and places it could be improved on.
### Drawback
    The fact that it lacks a button for the user to click on to manually filter the table is just removing a function for no real reason, some users might be confused there's no clear instruction or button to filter the results.
### Recommendation 1:
    The lack of ability to filter multiple values for any column makes selecting a certain group from the list impossible. For example, if the user could select sightings from multiple cities or a range of dates the filtering would be improved to better suit the user searches.
### Recommendation 2:
    Adding additional filters for the other columns on the table could be helpful. For the larger comments section, it could just include any comments that contain the keywords the user enters for the search filter.
